# _**Self Study**_

## **Objectives**
* Understand HTML/CSS Fundamentals
* Understand JS Fundamentals

## **201 Review and 301 Course Preparations**
* **Semantic HTML**
    * Practice working with semantic HTML5 tag/element structures by creating simple layouts and UI features
        * This includes: <section>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, etc.
    * Understand the importance of clean, simple HTML markup in order to quickly and efficiently use CSS to style a webpage

* **Basic CSS**
    * Fully understand the concept of separating your CSS  into it's own file and how to include this in an HTML document
    * Fully understand the concept of parent/child/sibling relationships in HTML and how to select these elements through the use of CSS element selector chains (ex: div, p, span)
    * Practive working with class selectors for elements that contain common styles
    * Practice working with ID selectors for elements that are unique

* **JS Fundamentals**
    * Work with and understand the following constructs:
    * **Basic Data Types** - understand the basic data types of JS, along with when/how they are used
        * Strings
        * Intergers
        * Arrays
        * Objects
        * Boolean(s)
    * **Functions** - what is the basic syntax and why are they used?
    * **Loops** - practice working with _**for loops**_ (and while loops) to access data from an array and perform interactions against them
    * **Objects** - practice modeling and working with object literals - once you've gained a solid understanding of this material, move on to the next topic - Object Constructors
    * **Object Constructor Functions** - understand the syntax and why they are used - practice creating constructor functions to house dynamic data - also practice _instantiating_ objects based on the dynamic data housed in a constructor function
    * **Object Instantiation**
        * Focus on fully understanding the pourpose/syntax instantiating a new object - start off with creating lots of object literals then refactor to use the constructor pattern to efficiently allow ofr less code and reusability
    * **Vanilla JS Libraries**
        * Practice including several JS libraries into your application for quick, efficient access to complex features
        * Understand the basics of how to review documentation in order to implement libraries without too much trial/error
        * Practice adding custom options as part of your library interdrationto understand how to leverage additional library functionality

* **GIT/GITHUB**
    * Fully understand the workflow process of ACP
        * _Add, Commit, Push_
    * Work with basic branching concepts
    * Practice creating PRs (pull requests)
    * Practice and understand basic merge conflict resolution

* **Practice jQuery and Frontend Templating**
    * Understand selection, traversal, and DOM manipulation
        * Understand what methods are available in jQuery that allows us to do that
    * Understand and be able to implement Handlebars (or any other frontend templating engine)
        * http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/

* **Build a SPA (Single Page Application) - TODO App**
    * Node/ExpressJS backend -> understand how to create routes on the backend and capture/send back to a client
    * Understand the WRRC (Web Request Response Cycle) and how the internet works -> what is "req" and what is "res"
    * Be able to build a simple frontend (no ejs or anything related) with a form that can submit data to your backend and can save it using a DB (postgreSQL)

* **Recap and Review Code 301 Code Challenges**
    * Focus on the first couple of challenges in each challenge (easy ones)

* **As an additiona to the "Build a SPA" above -> fully know and understand the WRRC**
    * Be able to create a WRRC diagram that shows how a client communicates witha server and how other 3rd party API's impact this process
    * Be able to describe the major parts of a request
    * Be able to describe the major parts of the response
    * Be able to describe the anatomy of a URL:
        * Querystrings
        * Optional Hash Parameters
        * Domain/Sub Domain
        * Path Structures
